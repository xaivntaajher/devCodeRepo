# Create a variable holding a string first name that you want to add to the previously-created list of instructors.
# Create a boolean variable that you can check to see if a duplicate entry has been found.
# Loop over the list and compare each element with the provided name.
# At the end of the loop, if no duplicate entry has been found, then append the new name to the list, then print out the list and print the length of the list.
# If a duplicate entry was found, print out the message: “Sorry that name has been taken, please provide a nickname”.
# Run this code three times, once to add “Brett”, once to add “Pascal” and finally to add “James”.
