# Given a list of numbers, manually sort the list into ascending order (may not use built in .sort() method).
# Suggested strategy:
# Starting with the first two numbers, compare them to see which is larger. 
# Place the lower number to the left and the higher number to the right.
# Iterate through the list, checking each pair of numbers one at a time.
# Repeat from the start until the entire list is sorted.
# Leave a comment above the function stating the time complexity.
# Send a screenshot of your solution and time complexity comment to your personal instructors chat.
